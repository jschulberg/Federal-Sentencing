# Federal Sentencing
This repository includes a thorough analysis of Federal Sentencing Guidelines. I will use a variety of exploratory and modeling techniques to answer the following questions:  

- What are the demographics of individuals sentenced for various crimes (age, race, gender, location, citizenship, level of education, etc.); 
- What are the types of sentences handed down (probation vs. prison time vs. fine, etc.); 
- How are the sentences handed down relate to the minimum and maximum sentences according to the guidelines (i.e. are sentences closer to the minimum guideline for white defendants and closer to the maximum guideline for defendants of color?) 

The repository is organized as follows:  

| Folder | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Code | This section includes all of the R code used for analysis. |
| Code | This section includes all of the code (both R and Python) used for analysis. |
| Data | This section includes the main datasets used throughout the analyses. |
